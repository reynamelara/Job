avoided list and disambiguation pages because these are not representative
unstructured text
A total of 700 articles were randomly selected
and set aside for developing the disambiguation algorithm: 500
for training; 100 for configuration, and a further 100 for final
evaluation.
The 500 training articles contain more than 50,000 links. Each
link represents several training instances. The connection between
an anchor term and its chosen destination gives a positive
example, while the remaining possible destinations provide
negative ones.
